## Catalog

### Community components

The Greengrass developer community builds and maintains components that you can deploy to your devices. Instead of building components for each required capability, you can choose components from the catalog to kick-start your IoT project. Since these components are a reference implementation of common patterns, please ensure that you appropriately review and test any functionality before deploying it to your production environments.

To request a feature or report a bug, open a GitHub issue on the repository for that component. Note: AWS does not guarantee support for the community components. Please check the corresponding CONTRIBUTING file for details.

Following is a list of Greengrass components.
